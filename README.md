# LinkedIn-Profile-Analytics
Hunting for a new job nowadays has become a tedious task, moreover keeping a track of all the applications is indeed challenging. There are several strategies and tools that can help one streamline the job hunting process and keep track of your applications effectively. I have made an attempt to create a dashboard on PowerBI focusing on my connections, companies I follow, invitations, messages etc.
1)	Extracted data from my LinkedIn profile
2)	Cleaned and transformed the data into PowerBI
3)	Created measures in PowerBI using Dax Expressions
